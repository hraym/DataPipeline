# World Bank Data Pipeline

## Project Overview

This data engineering solution automates the extraction, processing, and analysis of World Bank economic indicators. It demonstrates a robust, scalable approach to constructing data pipelines for economic analysis and business intelligence applications.

## Key Features

- Asynchronous data retrieval from the World Bank API
- Customizable selection of economic indicators and countries
- Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms
- Modular architecture facilitating maintenance and testing
- Efficient data processing and cleaning utilizing pandas
- Automated data quality checks and validation
- (Optional) Dynamic visualization of key economic trends

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies: aiohttp, pandas (full list in requirements.txt)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/world-bank-data-pipeline.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd world-bank-data-pipeline
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Execute the main script with desired parameters:

```bash
python main.py --indicators <indicator_codes> --countries <country_codes> --start_year <start> --end_year <end>
```

Example:
```bash
python main.py --indicators NY.GDP.MKTP.CD SP.POP.TOTL --countries USA CHN JPN --start_year 2000 --end_year 2020
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Execute the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Data Visualization Capabilities

(If implemented, describe visualization features and their business applications)

## Extensibility and Customization

The modular design allows for easy integration of additional data sources, processing steps, or analytical models. Customization can be achieved by modifying the relevant modules or extending the pipeline class.

## Performance Considerations

The asynchronous data fetching mechanism ensures efficient retrieval of large datasets. For very large data volumes or real-time processing needs, consider implementing a distributed processing framework.

## Security and Compliance

Data is processed locally, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. Implement appropriate access controls and encryption if deploying in a multi-user or cloud environment.
